# Multiplayer Web Application

This is a multiplayer web application where players can submit Unicode characters to a 10x10 grid, with real-time state management and socket connections. The application consists of two parts:

- **Client**: Frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Server**: Backend powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Install Node.js (version >= 18) from [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. **MongoDB**: You need a MongoDB instance. You can either run it locally or use a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
3. **Git**: Make sure Git is installed.

## Running the Project Locally
